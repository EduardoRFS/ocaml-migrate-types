# ocaml-migrate-types

Convert OCaml Types to the most recent version

Supported versions are 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11 and 4.12. For each version, there is a snapshot of the Types and conversion functions to the next version.

So that a tool using with the last version of the OCaml typechecker will be capable of understanding older types.
